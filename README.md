### **♻️ GREEN LOOP - Circular Economy Platform**
**React.js | Node.js | MongoDB | Express.js**

**🏆 1st Place Winner - National Eco Hackathon 2026**

Three-sided marketplace connecting restaurants, logistics providers, and farms to monetize organic waste as agricultural fertilizer. Won first place among 38 teams judged by investors and entrepreneurs.

**Business Model Innovation:**

- Designed logistics optimization algorithm projecting 30% waste-to-fertilizer conversion efficiency
- Potential to divert 3.9M tons from Algeria's 13M-ton annual organic waste stream

**Why We Won:** Focused on **unit economics and commercial viability** over technical complexity. Judges valued business model clarity more than feature sophistication.

### **🍽️ PIRIMI - Food Waste Reduction Platform**
**MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**

Marketplace connecting Algerian retailers selling near-expiry products with price-conscious consumers and charitable associations. Currently conducting user validation with 15+ shop owners to refine commission-based revenue model.

**Problem Solved:** Algeria wastes $4B annually in food while consumers face affordability challenges. PIRIMI creates win-win: retailers monetize otherwise-lost inventory, consumers access affordable food, associations receive donations.

**Status:** MVP development, launching pilots Q2 2026

## 💡 Professional Philosophy

> **"I build technology solutions grounded in actual market needs and revenue generation, not theoretical applications."**

My approach combines:
- ✅ **Technical execution capability** (MERN/Laravel expertise, rapid prototyping)
- ✅ **Commercial awareness** (5+ years B2B operations, supplier negotiations, pricing strategy)
- ✅ **Entrepreneurial validation** (competition wins, pilot traction, market testing)

I don't just ask "Can we build this?" I ask "**Will customers pay for this, and can we deliver it profitably?**"
